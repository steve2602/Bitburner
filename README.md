# Bitburner
None of these scripts are originally mine. Most are taken from other creators with some small tweaks to some to allign them with the requirements for this automation.
Bitburner Scripts

This will automatically start hacking all avalible nodes and copying over files required for automation. This will run off your "personal PC" so likely to be best after the tutorial stages and 1 or 2 ram upgrades.

These scripts will do the following:

Copy.js = Auto hack constantly for any device you can gain root to or run a .exe against. This cannot auto backdoor.
hmgw.js = this script starts to create others locally and on devices hacked, this is great for early game and stays great throughout. I found this could not fill my threats on larger servers so others were required.
Stockmarket.js = This will autobuy/sell stock (you need to ensure you visit the stockmarket to ensure all upgrades are purchased, you need to at least be able to trade to use this).
hnet-full.js = this will automate upgrades to hnet. (this is not great for a first run as augments tend to really improve this)
Master.js = Personal server automation script and some other servers not filled by the other automatic script. (I have attempted to corrected the issues in worker that caused faults when calculating growth threads although it appears to still happen a few times, etc to remove the faults and it should clear up after a few.)
Auto-Server1.js = Purchases servers and auto upgrades. Master.js contains a script to buy servers also but from my testing it was not working and I haven't gone through troubleshooting.
